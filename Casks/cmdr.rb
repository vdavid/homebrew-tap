  # Hand "Show in Finder" back before leaving. macOS routes it by bundle id, through the
  # undocumented NSFileViewer key of the global preferences domain, and when that id names an
  # app that is gone it does NOT fall back to Finder: the command silently does nothing, in
  # every app, machine-wide, until someone clears the key by hand. Cmdr only ever writes it
  # when the user asks (Settings > Behavior > Navigation & file ops), so uninstalling has to
  # take it back out.
  #
  # In uninstall, never only in zap: zap runs on `brew uninstall --zap` alone, and a plain
  # `brew uninstall cmdr` is the case that would break someone's Mac. The test on the current
  # value is the other half: Path Finder and ForkLift write the same key, and clearing it
  # blind would unregister theirs. Only this one key is touched, never the plist holding it.
  #
  # Known cost: Homebrew runs uninstall directives for `brew reinstall` and for a `--greedy`
  # upgrade too, and nothing in the cask DSL distinguishes those from a real uninstall. Both
  # leave the switch off, which the user can turn back on in Settings. A dangling key can't be
  # turned back on by anyone.
